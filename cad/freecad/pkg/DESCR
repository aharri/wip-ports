FreeCAD is a general purpose Open Source 3D CAD/MCAD/CAx/CAE/PLM
modeler, aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but
also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering, such as
architecture or other engineering specialties. It is a feature-based
parametric modeler with a modular software architecture which makes it
easy to provide additional functionality without modifying the core
system.

FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an
Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the
Coin 3D library, and a broad python API.
