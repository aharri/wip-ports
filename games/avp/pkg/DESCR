Alien versus Predator is a science fiction first person shooter game.

You can play as colonial marine, alien or as a predator. As a marine
you must fight your way through the research complex and exterminate
the alien queen. If you choose to play as an alien you need to protect
the hive from marines and finally escape to earth. Predator's story
is three phased: first you must recover a space craft, kill the 
alien/predator hybrid that the humans created and finally kill
the alien queen.

You need game data from AvP: Gold to play this.
