The Free Heroes II project (FHeroes 2) aims to create a free
implementation of Heroes of Might and Magic II engine using SDL.

Note that you must have HoMM II datafiles from elsewhere.

System wide data directory  : ${PREFIX}/share/fheroes2
Per-user game data directory: ~/.fheroes2

One of those directories should contain the following:

data/HEROES2.AGG
maps/*.MP2
