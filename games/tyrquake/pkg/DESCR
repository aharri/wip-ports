TyrQuake is meant to be a fairly conservative branch of the Quake
source code. It's intended to support Quake and Quakeworld in both
software and GL versions, as well as the Quakeworld Server.  The
intent is not to change the look and feel by adding rendering
enhancements, but rather to fix bugs and add other minor enhancements.
