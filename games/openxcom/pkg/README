| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to play the game you need original data from
"UFO: Enemy Unknown" / "X-Com: UFO Defense".
For a system wide installation you can copy them to
one of the following directories:
    $XDG_DATA_HOME/openxcom/data/
    $XDG_DATA_DIRS/openxcom/data
    ${PREFIX}/share/openxcom/data/

For a user specific installation you can copy them to your home:
    ~/.local/share/openxcom/data/
    ~/.openxcom/data/ 

Once data has been set up you can execute 'openxcom'.
