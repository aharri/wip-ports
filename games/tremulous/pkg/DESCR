Tremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based FPS with
elements of an RTS. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and
humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures
in-game like an RTS. These structures provide many functions, the most
important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are
spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game
after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some
degree), healing functions and much more.
